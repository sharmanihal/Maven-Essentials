### Steps to Download and Install Maven on Windows

1. **Check Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure that Java is installed on your system.
   - Verify the Java installation by running `java -version` in the Command Prompt.  
   - If Java is not installed, [download and install the JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) and set up the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

2. **Download Maven:**
   - Go to the [official Maven download page](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
   - Download the **binary zip archive** for Windows (e.g., `apache-maven-x.x.x-bin.zip`).

3. **Extract Maven:**
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a preferred directory, such as `C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven`.

4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   - Open the **System Properties** dialog:
     - Press `Win + Pause/Break` → Click on **Advanced system settings** → Go to the **Advanced** tab → Click **Environment Variables**.
   - Add Maven to the `PATH`:
     1. In **System Variables**, find and select the `Path` variable, then click **Edit**.
     2. Add the Maven `bin` directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven\bin`).
   - Set the `MAVEN_HOME` variable:
     1. Click **New** in **System Variables**.
     2. Name the variable `MAVEN_HOME` and set its value to the directory where Maven was extracted (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven`).

5. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open the Command Prompt.
   - Run the command:  
     ```sh
     mvn -v
     ```
   - If Maven is correctly installed, you will see the Maven version, Java version, and other system details.

That's it! Maven is now installed and ready to use on your Windows system.
