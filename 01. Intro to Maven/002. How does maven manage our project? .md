# Maven Overview

## What is Maven?
- **Open Source**
- An **Apache Project**

## How Does Maven Manage a Project?
- **Provides Project Structure and Manages Contents**: Defines where things like source code, test code, etc., should go.
- **Manages Dependencies**: Automatically handles libraries your project needs.
- **Configurable Project Object Model (POM)**: Offers a default configuration but allows customization as needed.
- **Task Automation**: Provides tasks to build, deploy, test, etc., and manages their execution order.

## Characteristics of Maven

### Core Characteristics:
1. **Convention Over Configuration**: If you follow Maven's conventions, minimal configuration is needed.
2. **Consistency**: Conventions make Maven projects look similar and easier to understand.
3. **Configurable**: While conventions exist, you can customize settings, such as changing the default folder structure.

### Additional Characteristics:
1. **IDE Agnostic**: You can build, deploy, and test without needing an IDE.
2. **IDE Supported**: Works seamlessly with modern IDEs.
3. **Declarative Dependency Management**: You specify what dependencies you need, and Maven handles the rest.
4. **Plugin-Based Architecture**: Most of Maven's features are powered by plugins.
