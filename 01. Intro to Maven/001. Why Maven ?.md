# Why Maven?

Maven is a **Project Management Tool**.

## What does that mean?

### A Java Project Structure:
- **Source Code**
- **Test Code**
- **Project Structure** (directories, assets, resources)
- **Libraries/Dependencies**
- **Configurations**
- **Task Runner**: build, test, run
- **Reporting**: e.g., number of classes, number of test cases passed, etc.

This looks quite complicated if we have to manage this on our own.

### This is where Maven comes in:
Maven manages all this for us using a concept called **Project Object Model (POM)**.

Maven being a project management tool means it simplifies and automates tasks like dependency management, standardized project structure, building, testing, running, and reporting. It handles everything through a central configuration file (`pom.xml`).
