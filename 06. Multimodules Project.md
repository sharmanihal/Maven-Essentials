# Creating a Maven Project with Multiple Modules

Maven allows you to create a multi-module project, where one Maven project (the parent project) contains multiple sub-projects (modules). This is useful for organizing related components, such as a web application with separate back-end, front-end, and shared libraries.

## Steps to Create a Multi-Module Maven Project

### **1. Create the Root Project (Parent Project)**  
Use the Maven `archetype:generate` command to create the parent project:  
```bash
mvn archetype:generate
```

1. After generating the project, delete the default source and test files. Retain only the `pom.xml` file.
2. Modify the parent project’s `pom.xml` to indicate that this is a *parent* project, not a project that generates an artifact (e.g., JAR).  
   Update the `<packaging>` tag:  
   ```xml
   <packaging>pom</packaging>
   ```
   This tells Maven that this project is a parent.

---

### **2. Create Child Projects (Modules)**  
To create child projects inside the parent folder:  
```bash
mvn archetype:generate
```

1. Run this command inside the parent project directory.  
2. Each child project will have its own `pom.xml` file.  
3. Maven automatically assumes that a Maven project inside another Maven project is a module.

---

### **3. Configure the Child POM Files**  
In each child project's `pom.xml`, link the child project to the parent project:  
```xml
<parent>
  <artifactId>[Parent Artifact ID]</artifactId>
  <groupId>[Parent Group ID]</groupId>
  <version>[Parent Version]</version>
</parent>
```
This establishes the parent-child relationship.

---

### **4. Configure the Parent POM File**  
In the parent project’s `pom.xml`, include references to all child modules:  
```xml
<modules>
  <module>[Child Artifact ID 1]</module>
  <module>[Child Artifact ID 2]</module>
</modules>
```
This tells Maven to include and build the child modules as part of the parent project.

## Example Structure

```
root-project/
├── pom.xml           (Parent POM with <packaging>pom</packaging>)
├── module-1/
│   └── pom.xml       (Child POM linked to parent)
├── module-2/
│   └── pom.xml       (Child POM linked to parent)
```

### Parent POM (`root-project/pom.xml`):  
```xml
<project>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>com.example</groupId>
  <artifactId>parent-project</artifactId>
  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <packaging>pom</packaging>

  <modules>
    <module>module-1</module>
    <module>module-2</module>
  </modules>
</project>
```

### Child POM (`module-1/pom.xml`):  
```xml
<project>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <parent>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>parent-project</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  </parent>
  <artifactId>module-1</artifactId>
</project>
```

## Key Notes
1. **Parent-Child Relationship**:  
   - The `<parent>` tag in the child POM connects it to the parent project.
   - The `<modules>` tag in the parent POM lists all child modules.
   
2. **Build Process**:  
   Run the following command in the parent project directory to build all modules:  
   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```

3. **Inheritance**:  
   Child projects inherit dependencies, plugins, and other configurations defined in the parent POM.  


By following these steps, you can create a well-organized Maven project with multiple modules.

# Advantages of Using a Multi-Module Maven Architecture

1. **Shared Properties and Dependencies**  
   - Common configurations like properties, dependencies, plugins, and build settings can be defined in the parent `pom.xml`.  
   - This reduces redundancy and ensures consistency across all modules.

2. **Remove Redundant Dependencies in Child Projects**  
   - If a dependency is already defined in the parent `pom.xml`, it does not need to be redefined in the child modules.  
   - This makes the child `pom.xml` files cleaner and easier to manage.

3. **Customizability for Child Modules**  
   - While inheriting from the parent, child projects can still add or override dependencies, plugins, or configurations to meet specific requirements.

4. **Smaller and Simpler Child POM Files**  
   - The child `pom.xml` files are significantly smaller since they inherit most configurations from the parent.  
   - This improves readability and maintainability of the codebase.

5. **Centralized Build Management**  
   - Running any Maven phase (e.g., `compile`, `test`, `install`) from the parent project triggers the same phase in all child modules in the order they are listed in the `<modules>` tag.  
   - This ensures a streamlined and consistent build process across all modules.

---

### Example Scenario:  

- **Parent POM** contains common dependencies like logging libraries or testing frameworks (e.g., SLF4J, JUnit).  
- **Child POMs** only define module-specific dependencies or plugins, reducing redundancy.

By using this architecture, teams can manage large projects with multiple components effectively while maintaining consistency and reducing duplication.
