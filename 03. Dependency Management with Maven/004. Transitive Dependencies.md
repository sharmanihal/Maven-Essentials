### What are Transitive Dependencies?

Transitive dependencies occur when:
- **A depends on B**, and
- **B depends on C**, which means **A also depends on C** (indirectly).

### Example:
- Your project includes dependency **A**.
- Dependency **A** requires another library **B** to function.
- Library **B** in turn depends on **C**.
  
This creates a chain: **A → B → C**.

### How Does Maven Handle Transitive Dependencies?
1. **Dependency Checking**:
   - Maven analyzes the dependencies of the libraries (e.g., if **A** depends on **B**, it checks if **B** has dependencies).
   
2. **Automatic Fetching**:
   - Maven downloads all transitive dependencies (e.g., **C**) and adds them to your project's classpath.

3. **Class Path Inclusion**:
   - All transitive dependencies are automatically included in the project's runtime environment.

### Benefits:
- You don’t need to manually declare or download transitive dependencies.
- Maven ensures the complete dependency chain is resolved and available.

### Example in `pom.xml`:
If you add the following dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-core</artifactId>
    <version>5.4.0.Final</version>
</dependency>
```

Maven will also download and include Hibernate's transitive dependencies, such as:
- **javax.persistence:javax.persistence-api**
- **antlr:antlr**

### Key Feature:
Maven simplifies dependency management by resolving transitive dependencies automatically.
