### Dependency Scopes in Maven

Dependency scopes define **when** and **where** a dependency should be available during the build lifecycle. Each scope has a specific purpose.

---

#### 1. **Compile Scope** (Default)
- **When Available**: During compile time, runtime, and for unit tests.
- **Use Case**: For dependencies required during both development and execution.
- **Example**:
    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.example</groupId>
        <artifactId>my-library</artifactId>
        <version>1.0</version>
        <!-- <scope>compile</scope> is default -->
    </dependency>
    ```

---

#### 2. **Test Scope**
- **When Available**: Only during the test phase.
- **Excluded From**: Final artifact.
- **Use Case**: For dependencies like JUnit that are required only for testing.
- **Example**:
    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
        <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>
        <version>5.8.2</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    ```

---

#### 3. **Provided Scope**
- **When Available**: During compile time but **not included in the final artifact**.
- **Use Case**: For dependencies provided by the runtime environment, like **Servlet API** in a web application.
- **Example**:
    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
        <artifactId>javax.servlet-api</artifactId>
        <version>4.0.1</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
    ```

---

#### 4. **Runtime Scope**
- **When Available**: Only during runtime, not during compile time.
- **Use Case**: For dependencies that are not needed for development but are required to run the application, such as JDBC drivers.
- **Example**:
    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>mysql</groupId>
        <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
        <version>8.0.33</version>
        <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
    ```

### Summary Table:
| **Scope**      | **Compile** | **Test** | **Provided** | **Runtime** |
|-----------------|------------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Compile Time** | ✅          | ❌        | ✅            | ❌           |
| **Runtime**     | ✅          | ❌        | ✅ (provided by runtime) | ✅           |
| **Test Phase**  | ✅          | ✅        | ✅            | ✅           |
| **Included in Final Build** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

By specifying the appropriate scope, you ensure your project has all required dependencies without unnecessary additions in your final artifact.
