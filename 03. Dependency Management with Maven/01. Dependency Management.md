### Dependency Management in Maven

Maven connects to remote repositories to fetch dependencies, such as third-party libraries, and manage them for you.

#### Traditional Approach to Managing Dependencies:
1. Go to a website (e.g., Apache Commons Logging).
2. Download the JAR file.
3. Manually add it to your classpath.

This can become cumbersome when managing multiple dependencies.

#### Maven's Declarative Dependency Management:
Instead of manually handling dependencies, you declare what you need, and Maven will fetch and manage them for you. 

For example, to include JUnit in your project, you simply add the dependency in your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit-jupiter-api</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Maven will:
- Fetch the correct version of the JAR.
- Add it to your classpath automatically.

### Dependencies in `pom.xml`

Dependencies in Maven are managed within a dedicated `<dependencies>` section in the `pom.xml` file. 

This section allows you to declare all the third-party libraries your project needs. Maven will automatically download and manage them for you.
