### Finding Maven Dependency Coordinates from Maven Central

You can use the **Maven Central Repository** to find and include dependencies in your project. Here's how:

1. **Go to the Maven Central Repository**:
   - Website: [https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central](https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central)

2. **Search for Your Dependency**:
   - Enter the name of the library you need (e.g., "Apache Commons Lang") in the search bar.
   - The search results will show all libraries related to your query.

3. **Select the Relevant Library**:
   - Click on the library you want to use.
   - You will see all available versions of that library.

4. **Get the Dependency Tag**:
   - Select the desired version, and Maven Central will provide the `<dependency>` tag to include in your `pom.xml`.

5. **Copy the Tag into Your `pom.xml`**:
   - Add the `<dependency>` tag provided by Maven Central to the `<dependencies>` section of your `pom.xml`.

This simplifies adding third-party libraries to your Maven project by providing all necessary details (group ID, artifact ID, and version).

### Fetching Dependencies After Adding to `pom.xml`

Simply adding a dependency to the `pom.xml` file does not automatically fetch the required jar files. You need to trigger Maven to download and add them to your project.

### Command to Fetch Dependencies:
Run the following command:
```bash
mvn compile

or we can run the below command to not trigger the complie

mvn dependency:resolve
```

### What Happens:
1. Maven reads the dependencies listed in your `pom.xml`.
2. It connects to the **Maven Central Repository** (or any specified repository).
3. Downloads the required jar files.
4. Adds the jar files to the project's **classpath**.

### Example:
After running the `mvn compile` command, you will see:
- The jar files are downloaded from the repository.
- They are added to the classpath.
- We now can use the library in our code.
