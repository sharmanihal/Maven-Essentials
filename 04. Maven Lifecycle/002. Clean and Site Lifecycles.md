# Maven Build Lifecycles

Maven provides three main lifecycles, each serving a specific purpose in the build process:

---

## 1. **Default Lifecycle**  
The **default lifecycle** handles the complete build process of a project. It consists of several phases, starting from validation and ending with the deployment of the project.  

### Key Phases:
1. **Validate**: Checks the project structure and `pom.xml`.
2. **Compile**: Compiles the source code.
3. **Test**: Runs unit tests.
4. **Package**: Packages the compiled code into a distributable format (e.g., `.jar`, `.war`).
5. **Verify**: Runs checks to ensure the package is valid.
6. **Install**: Installs the package in the local Maven repository.
7. **Deploy**: Deploys the package to a remote repository.

---

## 2. **Clean Lifecycle**  
The **clean lifecycle** is used to clean up the project by removing all build-generated artifacts, such as the `target` directory.  

### Key Phase:
- **Clean**: Deletes the files generated during the build process.

### Command:
```bash
mvn clean
```

**Use Case**:  
If you want to start fresh or clean up old build artifacts before creating a new build, this lifecycle is used.

## 3. **Site Lifecycle**  
The **site lifecycle** is used to generate project documentation and deploy it to a server.

### Key Phases:
1. **Site**: Generates project documentation (e.g., test reports, project info).  
2. **Site-Deploy**: Deploys the generated site/documentation to a server.  

### Commands:
- To generate documentation:  
  ```bash
  mvn site
  ```
- To deploy the documentation:  
  ```bash
  mvn site-deploy

  POM Changes to deploy at a server:
  <distributionManagement>
    <site>
      <id>my-server</id>
      <url>scp://your-server.com/path/to/site</url>
    </site>
  </distributionManagement>
  ```



**Use Case**:  
When you want to create detailed reports, such as test case execution details or project summaries, and share them via a hosted site.
