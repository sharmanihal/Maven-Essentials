### **How Maven Works with Plugins**
1. **Plugins Drive All Actions**:  
   Maven does not perform any functionality directly; it delegates all tasks (like compiling, packaging, cleaning, etc.) to plugins. Every phase in a Maven lifecycle corresponds to a plugin's specific goal.

   - For example:
     - **Compilation**: Handled by the `maven-compiler-plugin`.
     - **Packaging**: Done by the `maven-jar-plugin`.
     - **Site Generation**: Managed by the `maven-site-plugin`.

2. **Phases and Goals**:  
   A **phase** in the Maven lifecycle triggers one or more plugin **goals**. For example:
   - The `compile` phase triggers the `maven-compiler-plugin:compile` goal.
   - The `package` phase triggers the `maven-jar-plugin:jar` goal.

3. **Plugin Management in `pom.xml`**:  
   The `<pluginManagement>` section in the `<build>` tag of your `pom.xml` file is where you define plugin versions and configurations. This helps avoid Maven's default versions and ensures consistent behavior across teams or projects.

   ```xml
   <build>
     <pluginManagement>
       <plugins>
         <plugin>
           <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
           <version>3.13.0</version>
         </plugin>
       </plugins>
     </pluginManagement>
   </build>
   ```

### **Default Shortcut Syntax**
Maven simplifies invoking plugin goals by associating **common plugins** with specific lifecycle phases. Instead of running `mvn pluginName:goalName`, you can directly invoke the phase, e.g., `mvn compile`.

#### Why can you just use `mvn compile`?  
- Maven has predefined lifecycle phases (`validate`, `compile`, `package`, etc.).
- It maps these phases to corresponding plugin goals:
  - `compile` → `maven-compiler-plugin:compile`
  - `package` → `maven-jar-plugin:jar`
  - `install` → `maven-install-plugin:install`

This mapping acts as a **shortcut**, so `mvn compile` automatically invokes the `maven-compiler-plugin:compile` goal.

---

### **What Happens When You Run `mvn install`?**
When you run a command like `mvn install`, Maven invokes all **phases in the lifecycle up to the `install` phase**, in the following order:

1. **Validate**: Validates the project structure and `pom.xml`.
2. **Compile**: Compiles the source code (using `maven-compiler-plugin`).
3. **Test**: Runs tests (using `maven-surefire-plugin`).
4. **Package**: Packages the code into a distributable format (e.g., a JAR file, using `maven-jar-plugin`).
5. **Install**: Copies the packaged artifact to the local repository (using `maven-install-plugin`).

Each phase triggers associated plugin goals automatically.

---

### **Adding Custom Plugins**
You can add custom plugins to your project to perform specialized tasks. Here's an example of adding a hypothetical plugin:

```xml
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>com.example</groupId>
      <artifactId>custom-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>custom-task</id>
          <phase>package</phase>
          <goals>
            <goal>custom-goal</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
```

In this case:
- The `custom-goal` of the `custom-plugin` will be executed during the `package` phase.
- These `custom-goal` comes with the plugin ,we just have to tell this goal is what we want to be invoked during this phase, and the plugin will take care of that.
- If you have multiple plugin in the same phase, order of exacution will be decided by order of occurance in pom xml.

### **Example: Viewing Plugin Invocations**
When you run `mvn install`, Maven executes multiple plugin goals in sequence. You can observe these plugin invocations by enabling debug logs:

```bash
mvn install -X
```

You’ll see output like this:

This shows:
1. The plugins Maven is using.
2. The specific goals being executed.
3. Their order in the lifecycle.

---

### **Summary**
- Maven’s lifecycle phases are powered by plugins.
- Shortcut commands like `mvn compile` work because Maven maps lifecycle phases to default plugin goals.
- You can customize the behavior by adding plugins to your `pom.xml` file.
- Use `mvn install` or `mvn <plugin-name>:<goal>` to see the plugins in action.

# If you dont specify a goal or a phase for you custom plugin:
In Maven, phases are part of the build lifecycle, which defines a sequence of tasks to execute. If no phase is specified, Maven doesn’t know where to start or stop in the lifecycle, so it won’t trigger any phases.

However, goals operate independently of the lifecycle—they represent specific tasks that plugins perform. Running a plugin goal without a phase means only that particular task is executed, without any lifecycle context.
