You're absolutely right! The Maven build lifecycle consists of several phases, and the commands you mentioned correspond to specific phases in that lifecycle. Each phase in Maven corresponds to a specific task or set of tasks in the project build process. Here's a breakdown of the **default lifecycle phases** in Maven:

### Maven Build Lifecycle Phases:
1. **Validate**: 
   - This phase checks the project structure, ensuring that the project is correctly configured.
   - Maven validates the `pom.xml` file and checks for necessary properties and settings.

2. **Compile**:
   - In this phase, Maven compiles the source code of the project (usually from the `src/main/java` directory).
   - It generates `.class` files from your Java source code.

   Command: 
   ```bash
   mvn compile
   ```

3. **Test**:
   - Maven runs the unit tests located in the `src/test/java` directory.
   - It compiles and executes the test classes (using the specified testing framework, e.g., JUnit or TestNG).
   - If tests fail, Maven stops the build process and reports the failure.

   Command:
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

4. **Package**:
   - After compiling and testing the code, Maven packages the compiled code into a distributable format (e.g., `.jar`, `.war`, `.ear`).
   - This phase is used to prepare the project for distribution.

   Command:
   ```bash
   mvn package
   ```

5. **Verify**:
   - This phase is used to perform any final checks, such as ensuring that the project is valid and ready for deployment.
   - It's often used for integration tests or checks that need to be performed after packaging.

   Command:
   ```bash
   mvn verify
   ```

6. **Install**:
   - In this phase, Maven installs the packaged artifact (e.g., `.jar`) into the **local Maven repository** (`~/.m2/repository`).
   - This makes it available for use in other projects on your machine.

   Command:
   ```bash
   mvn install
   ```

7. **Deploy**:
   - This phase uploads the artifact to a **remote Maven repository** (like Maven Central or a company-specific repository).
   - Once deployed, the artifact is available to other developers and projects.

   Command:
   ```bash
   mvn deploy
   ```

### Dependency Resolution:
- **`mvn dependency:resolve`**: This command resolves and downloads the dependencies for your project, ensuring all external libraries and artifacts are fetched from the remote repositories.

### Summary of Maven Build Lifecycle:
- The build lifecycle follows a sequence from validation to deployment.
- Each phase in the lifecycle is designed to handle a specific part of the build process, from compiling the code to running tests, packaging the project, and installing or deploying the artifact.

### Example:
When you run `mvn install`, Maven will execute all the phases up to **install**, which means:
1. **Validate**: Validates the project.
2. **Compile**: Compiles the source code.
3. **Test**: Runs the unit tests.
4. **Package**: Packages the compiled code into a `.jar` file.
5. **Verify**: Verifies the build.
6. **Install**: Installs the artifact into the local repository.

Similarly, when you run `mvn package`, Maven will perform the compile, test, and package phases, but it will **not install** the artifact locally.
