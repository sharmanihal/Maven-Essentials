### Maven Local Repository and Caching

#### Local Repository
Maven uses a **local repository** to cache dependencies on your machine. This helps avoid redundant downloads from remote repositories, speeding up builds after the initial dependency fetch.

- **Default Location**:  
  `C:\Users\<User-Name>\.m2\repository` (on Windows)  
  `~/.m2/repository` (on Unix-based systems)

#### Structure of Local Repository
Dependencies in the local repository are organized as:
- **Group ID** → **Artifact Name** → **Version** → **JAR**  
  Example:  
  ```
  org/
      apache/
          commons/
              commons-lang3/
                  3.12.0/
                      commons-lang3-3.12.0.jar
  ```

#### Why Does Maven Cache Dependencies?
1. **Faster Builds**: 
   - The first time you declare a dependency in `pom.xml`, Maven downloads it from the remote repository and caches it locally.
   - Subsequent builds use the local version, skipping the download.

2. **Reduced Network Usage**: 
   - Maven avoids repeatedly fetching the same dependency.

#### Exception: Snapshot Versions
- **Snapshot versions** (e.g., `1.0-SNAPSHOT`) represent **in-progress development builds**.
- Maven does not assume snapshot versions are stable:
  - It re-fetches snapshot dependencies every 24 hours by default.
  - This ensures you always have the latest development build.

You can configure this behavior in your `settings.xml` file if needed. For instance, by reducing or increasing the update interval.
