### Enterprise Maven Repository Setup

In an enterprise setup, Maven repositories are structured to handle internal and external artifacts efficiently. Here's how this works:

1. **Internal Artifacts**:  
   - Enterprises often have proprietary libraries or dependencies that are not shared with the public.  
   - These libraries are hosted in an **internal company Maven repository**, ensuring they remain private.

2. **How Maven Resolves Dependencies**:
   - When a dependency is declared:
     1. Maven first checks the **local repository** on the developer's machine.  
     2. If not found, it queries the **company's internal repository**.  
     3. If the dependency is still not found, it falls back to **Maven Central**. (Sometimes this might not even be allowed by the company, so you can use only the artifacts that are authorized by the company policies.

3. **Benefits of a Company Repository**:
   - Centralized management of internal libraries.
   - Faster builds for developers within the organization, as shared dependencies are cached locally in the company repository.
   - Enhanced security and control over internal dependencies.
   - Isolation from external repository issues, such as downtime or changes in public repositories.

This structure helps enterprises maintain control over dependency management while leveraging Maven's flexibility.
