### Maven Install

When you run the command `mvn install`, Maven does two key things:

1. **Compiles your project** (if it hasn't been compiled already).
2. **Packages the project** into the specified artifact (e.g., `.jar`, `.war`).
3. **Installs the artifact** into your **local Maven repository** (which is typically located at `~/.m2/repository` on your machine).

### What happens after running `mvn install`?
- The artifact (e.g., `my-project-1.0.jar`) is added to your local Maven repository, which is where Maven looks to resolve dependencies.
- Once it's in the local repository, other developers or projects on your machine can reference it as a dependency in their `pom.xml`.

### Example:

Let's say you have a project with the following details:
- **groupId**: `com.example`
- **artifactId**: `my-app`
- **version**: `1.0-SNAPSHOT`

You would run the following Maven command in the project's root directory:

```bash
mvn install
```

This will:
- Compile the project.
- Package it into a `.jar` (or `.war`, depending on the packaging type).
- Place it in your **local Maven repository** at `~/.m2/repository/com/example/my-app/1.0-SNAPSHOT/my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

### Using it as a dependency in another project:
Once installed, you can reference it in another project's `pom.xml` as follows:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>my-app</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

### Important Notes:
- **Local repository**: By default, the artifact is only available to your machine's local repository (`~/.m2/repository`), which means only other projects on the same machine can reference it.
- **Remote repository**: If you want to share the artifact with other developers or teams, you would need to deploy it to a **remote repository** (like Maven Central or a company-specific repository). For that, you can use the command:
   ```bash
   mvn deploy
   ```

This uploads the artifact to a remote repository, where it can be fetched by others across different machines.
