# Maven Coordinates and Artifact Identification

## Maven Central Repository
Maven maintains a centralized repository that contains all artifacts and their versions.  
This "monolithic universe" allows developers to access libraries and dependencies easily.

### How Are Artifacts Identified Uniquely?
Maven uses **Maven Coordinates**, a combination of values that uniquely identify each artifact. These include:

1. **Group ID**:  
   Represents the group or organization behind the project.  
   Example: `com.google` (reverse domain name).

2. **Artifact ID**:  
   Represents the specific project.  
   Example: `android`.

3. **Version**:  
   Indicates the version of the artifact.  
   Example: `14.0.0`.

4. **Packaging**:  
   Specifies the type of artifact (e.g., JAR, WAR, etc.).  
   Example: `jar`.

### Example Maven Coordinates
| Field       | Example Value        |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Group ID**  | `com.google`         |
| **Artifact ID** | `android`           |
| **Version**     | `14.0.0`            |
| **Packaging**   | `jar`               |

Together, these four coordinates uniquely identify an artifact in the repository.

## Maven Coordinates in `pom.xml`
These Maven coordinates are also specified in the `pom.xml` file of a project, as seen earlier:
```xml
<groupId>org.test</groupId>
<artifactId>calculator-app</artifactId>
<version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
<packaging>jar</packaging>
```

This helps Maven locate, download, and use the correct artifact in your project.
