# Generating Artifacts with Maven

Once you generate an artifact from your project, it will have the four Maven coordinates attached to it to uniquely identify it.

### How to Generate Artifacts (JAR/WAR) for Your Code?
Maven provides several commands that allow you to generate artifacts like JAR or WAR files.

### Maven Phases
In Maven, tasks like compiling, testing, and packaging are broken down into steps, which are referred to as **phases**. These phases represent the life cycle of a Maven project.

Typical steps involved in developing a Java project:
- **Compile**: Compiling the source code.
- **Test**: Running unit tests.
- **Unit Testing**: Verifying individual components.
- **Integration Testing**: Verifying the integration of components.
- **Build**: Generating a JAR or WAR file.
- **Release**: Making the artifact available for distribution.

### Maven Compile Phase
Let's start by looking at compiling the code using Maven.

1. **Make Changes to Your Code**:
   Suppose we add an `Addition` class to our `calculator-app` project:
   ```java
   package org.test;
   public class Addition{
       public double add(double a , double b){
           return a + b;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Compile the Code with Maven**:
   - Open the Command Prompt or Terminal in your project directory.
   - Run the following command:
     ```sh
     mvn compile
     ```

3. **Where Are the Compiled Class Files?**
   - The compiled class files are stored in the `target` directory.  
   - **Note**: Maven only compiles the source code (`src/main/java`) and not the test code (`src/test/java`), as the test code is handled in a separate phase.

   The `mvn compile` command compiles all the Java files in your `src/main/java` directory, and the output is placed in the `target` folder.
