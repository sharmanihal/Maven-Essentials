# Running Tests and Packaging the Project in Maven

Once you’ve compiled the source code, the next step is to run tests and package the project.

### Running Tests with Maven
You don’t want to run every test file manually. With Maven, you can run all the tests in your project automatically using the `mvn test` command.

1. **Run the Tests**:
   - Simply run the following command:
     ```sh
     mvn test
     ```

2. **What Happens Behind the Scenes**:
   - Maven will find all the test files in the `src/test/java` folder (it knows where they are due to the project structure).
   - Maven compiles the test classes and then runs all the tests.

3. **Test Output**:
   - After running the tests, Maven will display the results in the terminal.
   - The compiled test classes will be placed in the `target` folder, and the results will be shown.

   Example images:

   - **Test Results After Running**:

### Packaging the Project into a JAR
Now that you're happy with the tests and code, you might want to package your project into a JAR file for distribution. 

1. **Package the Project**:
   - Run the following command:
     ```sh
     mvn package
     ```

2. **What Happens When You Run the Command**:
   - Maven will compile your source code, run the tests, and then package everything into a JAR file.
   - The JAR file will be created in the `target` folder.

3. **Output**:
   - The JAR file will be located in the `target` folder, ready to be shared.

   Example image:
   - **JAR File Created in Target Folder**:

### JAR File Naming Convention

The JAR file follows a specific naming convention:
```
artifactId-version-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

For example:
```
calculator-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

This naming convention is derived from the values in the `pom.xml` file. You can modify this naming pattern by adjusting the `artifactId`, `version`, and other settings in the `pom.xml` file.
