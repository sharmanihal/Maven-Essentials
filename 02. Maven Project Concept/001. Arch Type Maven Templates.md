# Maven Archetypes and Project Structure

## Maven's Convention Over Configuration
Maven is very particular about how a project is structured. This is known as **convention over configuration**.  
You can either:
- Learn all the rules for Maven's structure, or  
- Let Maven create the structure for you.

## Maven Archetypes
Archetypes are pre-defined project templates that serve as a starting point for your Java project.  
Examples of archetypes include:
- Spring Boot project templates
- Servlet project templates

### Creating Templates with Maven
To create a project using Maven archetypes, use the following command:
```sh
mvn archetype:generate
```

### What Happens?
1. This command connects to Maven's central repository.
2. It downloads a list of available archetype templates.
3. You can choose one of these templates to create your project.

### Example Output
```sh
2200: remote -> org.apache.maven.archetypes:maven-archetype-quickstart (An archetype which contains a sample Maven project.)
```

Maven prompts you to select a template and version:  
```sh
Choose a number or apply filter (format: [groupId:]artifactId, case sensitive contains): 2200:
Choose org.apache.maven.archetypes:maven-archetype-quickstart version:
1: 1.0-alpha-1
2: 1.0-alpha-2
...
9: 1.5
Choose a number: 9:
```

### Configuring Properties
After selecting the archetype, Maven asks for project properties:
1. **Group ID**: Groups related projects.  
   Example: `org.test`
2. **Artifact ID**: The name of the specific project.  
   Example: `calculator-app`
3. **Version**: Specifies the version of the project.  
   Default: `1.0-SNAPSHOT` (Snapshot indicates the project isn't ready for release yet.)
4. **Package**: Typically the same as the group ID.  
   Example: `org.test`

Example input during the process:
```sh
Define value for property 'groupId': org.test
Define value for property 'artifactId': calculator-app
Define value for property 'version' 1.0-SNAPSHOT: 
Define value for property 'package' org.test: 
```

Once complete, Maven creates the project structure based on the chosen archetype.


# What Happens Behind the Scenes with Maven Archetypes?

### Steps:

1. **Connect to Remote Repository**:

   - Maven connects to the default repository: [repo1.maven.apache.org](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/).

   - You can change this default repository or configure multiple repositories if needed.

2. **Request List of Archetypes**:

   - Maven asks the repository for a list of available archetypes.

3. **Display Archetype List**:

   - Maven shows you the list of archetypes retrieved from the repository.

   - You pick an archetype using its Archetype ID.

4. **Download the Selected Archetype**:

   - Once you select an archetype, Maven downloads its template files from the repository.

5. **Create Project**:

   - Maven uses the downloaded archetype to generate a project structure based on the template.
